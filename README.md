# Note
- While the home page of the application is hosted through Azure Static Web Apps, other components, including the ChatBot, benefit from Azure's infrastructure.
(I was unable to deploy the complete web app using azure as azure web app  had some technical issues as stated by microsoft suppport for the Azure Student Subscription. )

- This Project is developed by Rajanala Prasuna using Azure Services for the purpose of Microsoft Future Ready Talent Internship 2024.
